                Our research endeavors are structured around three primary themes: Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Systems. Each theme encompasses distinct research objectives and presents its own set of challenges. The faculty members within our organization concentrate on generating influential contributions to the field as a whole. They achieve this by targeting significant problems within these major directions, thus addressing numerous vital societal applications. Although our research areas are classified under these themes, many of them cover a diverse array of sub-topics and practical applications. As a result, they often transcend the boundaries between these categories, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of our work.
