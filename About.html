                We live in an era dominated by Information Technology, with Computer Science serving as its backbone. To fully harness the potential of Information Technology and drive swift economic progress, understanding computer science is imperative. This field encompasses the creation and study of applications we use daily, the software systems supporting these applications, and the techniques for generating both in a reliable, correct, and ethical manner. Central to Computer Science is the competency in computer programming. Employers hiring Computer Scientists anticipate skilled programmers with a grasp of contemporary techniques and tools, and the capacity to use robust engineering principles in the production, development, and upkeep of computer programs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The variety of courses offered by the department and the skills students gain equip them to secure jobs in various sectors of the economy. Our curriculum prepares graduates for roles in the computing industry, where they can contribute their unique skills to project teams or research and development groups. Additionally, the course forms a foundation for further study or research by introducing students to both established and emerging technologies and methodologies, as well as the active research areas within Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Department provides two undergraduate degree programs: a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with two tracks, one being Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and the other Major-Minor (3:2:2:1), along with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
