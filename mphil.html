                    Embrace world class gradate education with unique blend of cutting-edge research and industry experience. This is generally a taught postgraduate degree, lasting one to two years full-time (or longer if part-time). The MPhil is often pursued by those intending to continue to a PhD, but it's also a respected degree in its own right.

                    The University of Ghana's Department of Computer Science offers two postgraduate programs: the Master of Science (MSc.) in Computer Science and the Master of Philosophy (MPhil.) in Computer Science.The MSc. program is a one-year program that can be pursued on weekends or evenings. It includes a capstone project as part of its curriculum. On the other hand, the MPhil. program is a two-year full-time program. The first year focuses on taught courses, while the second year is dedicated to research and dissertation work. Both programs are designed to provide an accelerated master's experience for individuals who can commit to either full-time or part-time study.These programs aim to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of theoretical computer science and advanced technical skills. The goal is to enable students to leverage technology as a disruptive force and effectively address complex problems within the global society. By the end of these programs, students will have gained practical experience in solving intricate and unstructured scientific problems. They will also have studied subjects such as Advanced Databases, Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms, and Networks.
