                    Embrace world class gradate education with unique blend of cutting-edge research and industry experience. This is generally a taught postgraduate degree, lasting one to two years full-time (or longer if part-time). The MPhil is often pursued by those intending to continue to a PhD, but it's also a respected degree in its own right.

                    Our doctoral program is a comprehensive research program that requires full-time dedication and typically lasts for four years. Successful completion of the program necessitates a high level of commitment from students.To fully engage in the program, students are expected to reside in close proximity to the University and actively participate as full-time members. The postgraduate committee will provide guidance to Ph.D. students, assisting them in creating a customized program of study. This program will encompass a major area of specialization as well as a minimum of two minor areas of specialization.In addition to coursework, the department organizes regular seminars where faculty members and students come together to review and critique research in the field. To encourage constructive critique, students are encouraged to join a research lab and actively participate in the research activities conducted by the group. The department focuses on research areas such as Intelligent Space and Machine Learning, Data Science/Big Data Analytics, Networking and Communications Engineering, and Cyber Security.
