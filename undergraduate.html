                    An undergraduate course is a class or series of classes that students take as part of an undergraduate degree program, typically leading to a Bachelor's degree. The exact structure, content, and duration of an undergraduate course can vary significantly depending on the field of study, the specific program, and the institution.

                    Short courses are educational programs that typically last from a few days to several weeks. They are designed to provide specific skills or knowledge in a particular area.These courses are designed for individuals who want to learn a new skill or hobby for personal satisfaction.

                    Embrace world class gradate education with unique blend of cutting-edge research and industry experience. This is generally a taught postgraduate degree, lasting one to two years full-time (or longer if part-time). The MPhil is often pursued by those intending to continue to a PhD, but it's also a respected degree in its own right.

                    Our PHDs lead the effort to extend the boundaries of knowledge through quality and industry relevant research. A PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) program in computer science is a high-level, research-focused degree that typically takes between 3-5 years to complete, the university, and the specific project.

                    The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.To qualify for admission into Computer Science programmes at Level 200, candidates must have taken the following courses at Level 100:Another important aspect of the curriculum is independent work. Each student does at least one design or research project advised by a member of the faculty. This gives students the opportunity to engage in cutting-edge research or entrepreneurial product design. Many projects are interdisciplinary. For students who would like to study computer science in earnest, but secondary to another discipline, we also offer the Certificate Program in Applications of Computing.Because of the broad range of topics within computer science and the diverse interests of undergraduates,  students may major in computer science through either the A.B. or B.S.E. degree program. We are the only department in the university with this flexibility. Beyond a small core set of courses, students are free to design their own program within a framework that insures in-depth exposure to algorithms and theoretical computer science, computer system design, and applications.
